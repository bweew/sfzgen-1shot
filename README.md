# sfzgen-1shot
used javascript to make a folder of samples into a sf2
- uses node js to loop through the folders on your computer
- those pesky hidden .ds files on mac need to be deleted if they creep in
- to convert from sfz to sf2 use polyphone
- you can use soundfontplayer in Fl studio to play sf2 files
